Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas are major health problems of chronic hepatitis
B virus (HBV) infection. To date, rare model has reproduced liver fibrosis associated with
long-term HBV infection which in turn has hindered both the understanding of HBV biology
and the development of new treatment options. Here, using adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) mediated delivery of a 1.2-kb HBV genome, we successfully generated a
chronic HBV infectious mouse model that presents the associated liver fibrosis observed
following human infection. After AAV8/HBV1.2 vector administration, mice demonstrated effective HBV replication and transcription which resulted in HBV antigen expression and viremia over 6 months. Although no obvious acute inflammatory response was noted, these
mice still developed chronic liver disease and hepatic fibrogenesis as demonstrated by increased ground glass-like hepatocytes, an increasing trend of collagen deposition and
upregulated fibrosis markers, including type I collagen, type III collagen, tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase (TIMP), and transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1). Taken together,
AAV-mediated HBV gene delivery to the mouse liver, induced HBV persistent infection accompanied by liver fibrosis which can serve as a model for investigating the precise mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis following chronic HBV infection as well as for the potential
development of novel therapeutics.

Approximately 240 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus
(HBV) and a large proportion of chronic infections develop into hepatocellular carcinoma or

cirrhosis [1]. These complications often result in liver failure and over one million deaths are
reported annually [2–4]. Thus, HBV-related diseases remain a major public health challenge.
Chronically-infected patients can be treated with several drugs, including IFN-α and nucleoside analogs such as lamivudine or adefovir. IFN-α regulates the immune response by increasing viral clearance, whereas nucleoside analogs interfere with viral DNA replication. However,
the effectiveness of these drugs is limited. And challenges remain in terms of their clinical application, including low efficacy, undesirable side effects, and resistant HBV mutations[5–9].
Thus, there is a need to develop both novel therapeutic reagents that inhibit HBV replication
and representative HBV animal models to evaluate new therapeutic strategies.
The key characteristic of hepadnaviruses is their high degree of species-specificity and hepatic tropism, such as lack specific receptors and cellular factors that are needed in viral entry
and trafficking which could make mice resistant to HBV infection [10–13]. Up to date, chimpanzees are the only permissive animals that are fully infected to HBV,and acute infections and
hepatitis would develop upon inoculation with HBV positive serum; however, these animals do
not envolve chronic liver disease, but develop cellular immune response similar to that demonstrated in human being during acute infection [14, 15]. However, several limitations including
large size, ethical issues, and high costs restrict their use for basic research and therapeutic drug
screening. The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a squirrel-like HBV permissive small animal,
but HBV infection only result in mild and transient infections [16]. HBV transgenic mice are
used to clarify the HBV replication mechanism and specific oncogenes function [17–20]. However, due to HBV genes integrated into the host genome and expressed as self-proteins and
thus, the mice are tolerant to these immunologically antigens and do not induce liver disease.
Mouse models using recombinant viral vectors or by hydrodynamic injection of naked HBV
genome DNA into hepatocytes were used to investigate immune tolerance to HBV antigens
and to study the mechanisms of viral clearance [21–24]. However, acute but not chronic, HBV
infection is often induced. Two recent studies used AAV to deliver HBV genome DNA to
mouse liver and induced HBV persistent infection and immune tolerance to HBV [25, 26].
Both papers tried to elucidate immune mechanism of the persistence HBV infection. Another
study elucidated the mechanisms of chronic HBV infection and immunopathogenesis in a humanized mouse model [27]. Thus, there is a need to develop a novel mouse model of persistent
HBV infection to investigate viral pathogenesis and to screen new antiviral drugs.
The present study developed a mouse model of persistent HBV infection by using an AAV
vector to transfer the hepatitis B virus genome (HBV1.2) into mouse liver cells which initiated
hepatitis B virus production, thereby leading to persistent viremia and the induction of liver fibrosis. This mouse model could be used to elucidate the biological process underlying HBV
pathogenesis and to screen small molecules that may be effective for the treatment of chronic
HBV infection and liver fibrosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
HEK 293T cells and Huh7.5.1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(Sigma, St Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin
(100U/ml). The cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Generation of the AAV-HBV vector (SSV9-1.2HBV)
A pHBV1.2 plasmid containing 1.2 copies of the HBV genome (genotype D) was used to generate the HBV fragment. This fragment was cloned into the pSSV9 vector (which contained
the inverted terminal repeat of AAV type 2 at both ends because the rep and cap genes were

exchanged) to generate pSSV9-1.2HBV. Briefly, p-SSV9 was digested with Xbal to generate a
linear vector and pHBV1.2 was digested with SacI and HindIII to generate the inserted fragment. The linearized p-SSV9 backbone and the HBV fragment were blunted using Klenow I
and then ligated using T4 ligase. Pseudotyped AAV8 vectors were produced in 293T cells using
a triple-plasmid transfection protocol and purified with CsCl gradients[28]. The vector titers
were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR).

In vitro study
Huh7.5.1 cells were seeded into a six well plate at 4×105 per well and cultured at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere. pSSV9-1.2HBV DNA (3μg) was transfected into the Huh7.5.1 cells of each
well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBS was used as control. The supernatant and transfected cells were harvested 72 hrs post-transfection and subjected to nucleic acid extraction using a viral DNA
isolation kit (QIANGEN) and then digested with DpnI. The recovered HBV viral DNA was
measured via qPCR. In a parallel assay, the supernatant was collected everyday for seven days
and replaced with the same amount of media to determine the cumulative abundance of
HBsAg and HBeAg by ELISA. At the same time, pSSV9-1.2HBV (10μg) was transfected to
Huh7.5 cell (2×106 cell) in 100mm dish. Southern-blot analysis of total DNA extrated from
transfected Huh7.5.1 cell and DNA samples extrated from HepG2.2.15 cell and Huh7.5.1 cell
as positive control and negtive control respectively. All DNA samples were digested with or
without selected restriction enzymes(EcoRI or HindIII) and were treated with Rnase A before
1.2% gel electrophoresis. The filters were hybridized with a DIG-labeled 3.2kb HBV specific
probe.

Animal study
Normal C57BL/6 mice (aged 6–8 weeks; Sichuan University, Sichuan, China) were bred and
maintained at the Laboratory Animal Facility of the Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese
Academy of Medical Science, Chengdu. Animal care and procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, which was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Chinese Academy of Medical Science
(Permit Number: ILAS-PG-2014-001). All efforts were made to minimize suffering. Mice were
injected with the AAV vector [2×1011 vector genome equivalents (vg)] in 200μl of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) via the tail vein. The serum for the ELISAs was prepared from tail bleeding, which was collected in heparinized capillary tubes using standard methods. After dilution
with PBS, the serum HBsAg and HBeAg concentrations were measured using an Auszyme
Monoclonal Diagnostic ELISA kit (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were analyzed using commercially available colorimetric assays (Teco Diagnostics, Anaheim, CA). To collect the livers
for the immunohistochemical and nucleic acid analyses, mice were anesthetized using 2.5%
avertin and perfused transcardially with cold PBS (pH 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
in phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/L pH 7.4). Intrahepatic HBcAg and HBsAg were visualized by
immunohistochemical staining of OCT-embedded tissues using rabbit anti-HBc and anti-HBs
antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), respectively, and the Envision HRP (diaminobenzidine)
system (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Ten random fields were selected per slide and the percentages
of HBsAg- and HBcAg-positive hepatocytes were quantified using Image-Pro Plus software
(Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). The liver sections were also examined by light microscopy
after standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome staining [29, 30]. Sirus
red staining of liver sections were observed by polarizingmicroscope.

qPCR and reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR
To measure the DNA levels of HBV and the AAV vector, nucleic acids were extracted using
DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at -80°C prior to PCR analyses. A qPCR standard curve was generated
using 10-fold dilutions of the SSV9-1.2HBV plasmid (1.0×103–1.0×109copies/ml). To measure
the mRNA levels of HBV, Timp-1, and Tgf-β1, total RNA was isolated using a NucleoSpinRNA
II kit (Macherey Nagal,GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) and reverse transcribed using a First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Toyobo, Japan). All of the qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate in 96-well optical reaction plates using an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and SYBR Green I PCR mix (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN) as previously described [31]. The primer sequences are shown in the S1 Table.

ELISA
The levels of collagen I and III in the liver and serum samples were determined using commercially available ELISA kits (Mouse Collagentype I (Col I) ELISA kit and Mouse Collagentype
III (Col III) ELISA kit); (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The serum levels of TIMP-1 and
TGF-β1 were also determined using commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). To prepare liver samples, up to100 mg of tissue was homogenized in 200μl of PBS
and centrifuged at 2000–3000g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and analyzed using
an ELISA kit.

Southern and Northern blotting
HBV replicative DNA intermediates and viral RNA were detected by Southern and Northern
blot analysis of total genomic liver DNA and RNA respectively with DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II and DIG Northern Starter Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). 3.2kb HBV genome was labeled by DIG as southern blot probe. For northern
blotting, PCR products were used for labeling and synthesized DIG labeled RNA as northern
blotting probes. GAPDH (house keeping gene) sequence from homo sapiens and rattus were
amplified by RT-PCR and used to normalize the amount of RNA bound to the membrane.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as the mean ±SD. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, Graphpad prism 5) to determine statistically significant differences
between groups. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
In vitro characterization of the recombinant AAV-HBV vector
HBV genomes have been delivered into the livers of mice via hydrodynamic injection and by
using an adenoviral vector; however, these methods can lead to the rapid clearance of the HBV
genomes. Alternatively, HBV-transgenic mice have been used to model HBV infections, however these mice are tolerant to the viral antigens and the persistent expression of self-antigens
limits their use for evaluating antiviral drugs. To overcome these limitations, the present study
attempted to generate a mouse model that faithfully mimics chronic HBV infection in humans.
As mice cannot be directly infected by HBV due to the lack of the HBV receptor required for
viral uptake, mice were injected with an AAV vector harboring HBV1.2 genomic DNA, which
has been used previously to induce HBV replication in both mouse hepatocytes and human
HepG2 cells[32, 33]. AAV8 is highly efficient in transducing mouse liver, so this serotype was

used to mediate HBV gene transfer in the present mouse model. As shown in Fig 1a, a fragment
that comprised 1.2 copies of HBV (genome D) was cloned into the p-SSV9 vector, which contained the ITR of AAV type 2 at both ends. To verify the HBV production and gene expression
of the construct, pSSV9-1.2HBV was transfected into Huh7.5.1 and the amount of viral genome DNA and HBsAg and HBeAg expression was evaluated. As indicated in Fig 1b, HBV
viral genome DNA was produced both in supernatant and in cells three days after transfection
(Fig 1b). However, the intracellular viral DNA content was approximately 300 times higher
than that found in the supernatant (Fig 1b). As shown in Fig 1c, HBsAg and HBeAg were produced at increasing trend overtime and secreted into the supernatant of the transfected cell. At
the same time, southern blot analysis of total DNA extracted from transfected Huh7.5.1 cell
showed relaxed-circle (rc) DNA, ds DNA and ssDNA (Fig 2a). EcoRI restriction enzyme (restriction enzyme cutting site included in HBV genome) and HindIII restriction enzyme (restriction enzyme cutting site was not included in HBV genome) were chosen to digest samples
in order to cut high molecular weight DNA strands into smaller fragments. Southern blot analysis of uncut total DNA sample was similar to HindIII treated sample, but different from EcoRI
treated sample. HBV relaxed-circle (rc) DNA and ds DNA were digested in EcoRI treated sample. These data verified that pITR2-1.2HBV induces HBV replication and gene expression in
Huh7.5.1 cell.

AAV vector mediates HBV genome transfer, replication, and
transcription in mouse liver
Following the in vitro plasmid vector verification, AAV8 vectors that harbor the 1.2HBV genome were produced in 293T cells as described previously[28]. Then, mice were injected intravenously with the AAV8-1.2HBV vector (2×1011vg). Two days post-injection (p.i.), over 90%
of the HBV DNA was distributed in the liver (Fig 3a). At 6 months p.i., the HBV DNA levels in
the liver had increased by 40% compared to two days p.i., whereas the levels were reduced
markedly in all other tissues examined (muscle, kidney, intestine, heart, and lung). This suggests that the HBV genome replicated in mouse liver. Two pairs of qPCR primers (S1 Table)
were used to quantify the HBV genome copy number. The first pair, which included a forward
primer located in the AAV2 ITR and a reverse primer located in the HBV X region, was used
to quantify the AAV vector DNA. The second pair of forward and reverse primers targeted in
the HBV S region and was used to quantify the HBV genome (including the AAV vector, replicated HBV, and HBV packaged virus). First, the HBV genome copy number was examined in
the serum at 0–6 months p.i.. The viral genome levels peaked at 2 weeks p.i., before decreasing
rapidly as they were cleared from the serum (Fig 3b). This was followed by a slow decrease in
genome abundance after 2 months. At the 2 week time point, the HBV genome and AAV vector levels detected by the two sets of primers were approximately equal; however, there was a
2–5-fold difference at the later time points (Fig 3b), suggesting that the HBV virus was secreted
into the serum. The HBV genome content of the mouse liver was also measured using the same
primer pairs. At the 1, 3, and 6 month time points, the overall HBV genome content was significantly higher than that of the AAV vector (Fig 3c). There was also an increasing trend at the
first three months, which suggested that the HBV genome replicated in the mouse liver. During
1–6 month post AAV8-1.2HBV injected, HBV replication intermediates(rc DNA, ds DNA and
ss DNA) were also observed in C57BL/6 mice by Southern blot analysis (Fig 2b), but covalently
closed circular DNA was not detected. These results demonstrated that encapsulated HBV
viral DNA was produced and that physiologically relevant viremia was present in the mouse
model. Transcription of HBV in the mouse liver was also examined by RT-qPCR and Northern
blot. Compared to the 1 month time point (3.65 ×107 copies/g), the amount of viral cDNA was

indicated. (b, c) Plasmid of pSSV9-1.2HBV (3μg) was transfected to Huh7.5.1 cell and determined the HBV viral genomes contents and/or the cumulative

200-fold higher at 3 months p.i., reaching 1.01×1010 copies/g at 6 months p.i. (Fig 3d). And
northern blot analysis of total Hepatic RNA extracted from injected mice, 3.5kb, 2.4kb and
2.1kb HBV transcripts were detected correlated with the expression of HBsAg in serum (Fig
2c). This confirmed that transgene transcription occurred following AAV-1.2HBV
vector delivery.

In vivo HBV gene expression levels and kinetics
Viral replication and viremia were detected in AAV-1.2HBV infected mice, but it was not sufficient for an adequate experimental model of HBV infection. Thus, AAV-mediated gene transduction in the serum and liver were analyzed by ELISA and immunohistochemical staining for
the HBV antigen, respectively. The results showed that AAV8-1.2HBV injection led to a persistent infection, which was characterized by the presence of HBsAg and HBeAg, or HBcAg in
the mouse serum and/or liver for 6 months. The secretion of viral antigens into the blood
was monitored over time. HBV surface antigen was detectable at 2 weeks p.i., peaking at
4.85×102ng/ml at 2 months. After this, the serum HBsAg level declined slowly and reached a
plateau concentration of 4.0×102ng/ml at 6 months p.i. (Fig 4a). The expression profile of
HBeAg showed a similar trend, except that it peaked at 1 month p.i. (Fig 4b). Interestingly, the
serum level of HBsAg remained relatively steady over the course of 6 months and there was a
lack of seroconversion to anti-HBs (both IgM and IgG). Immunohistochemical staining was
used to detect the expression of HBsAg and HBcAg in the livers of mice treated with
AAV8-HBV1.2. As shown in Fig 4c, similar to the serum expression profile, HBsAg-positive
hepatocytes were distributed randomly throughout the liver at 1 month p.i. and most visual

fields contained no stained cells, although some rare hepatocytes showed light staining of the
cytoplasm. However, the expression of HBsAg showed an increasing trend during the 6
months period, which may have reflected a cumulative effect. The expression of HBcAg occurred rapidly, which was obvious throughout the liver at 1 month p.i., and increased significantly at 3 months p.i. before remaining relatively stable. By contrast, cells from the HBV(-)
group exhibited no staining. These results demonstrate that the AAV vector mediated HBV
transgene production.

AAV8-1.2HBV does not generate obvious acute inflammation, but
induces liver fibrosis accompanied by chronic liver injury
ALT and AST are enzymes located in liver cells that are released into the circulation by necrotic
hepatocytes. Therefore, we monitored these transaminase concentrations in the serum to assess
the toxicity following AAV8-1.2HBV vector administration. Compared with HBV(-) mice,
AAV8-1.2HBV infection did not increase the serum ALT levels over the course of 6 months
(Fig 5a), whereas the serum AST level increased modestly at 1 and 2 months p.i.; however, this
difference was not statistically significant. Animals treated with AAV8-1.2HBV did not exhibit
other symptoms of systemic toxicity (data not shown). The increased AST levels at 1 and 2

months p.i. may have been associated with HBV transgene expression. These results demonstrate that there was no obvious acute inflammatory response after AAV8-1.2HBV injection.
Previous studies show that the chronic inflammation related to HBV infection contributed
to liver fibrosis in human patients[34, 35]. To investigate whether liver fibrosis and chronic
liver injury were present following AAV81.2HBV transduction, histopathological changes in
liver sections were analyzed overtime by H&E, Masson’s staining and Sirus red stain. As shown
in Fig 5b, mild inflammation and hepatic necrosis were indicated. A mild inflammatory cell infiltration surrounding the portal area (black arrow) was shown by H&E staining at 1, 3, and 6
months p.i., and most of hepatocytes were normal up to 3 months p.i.. At 6 months p.i., however, the hepatic lobular structure was marked damage and ground glass-like hepatocytes were
indicated, macrovesicular steatosis degeneration (blue arrow) was also observed and the vascular and portal areas was obviously broadened. Collagen (stained blue by Masson’s staining and
red by Sirus red stain; yellow and white arrow) deposition was observed by an increasing trend
during the study period (Fig 5b). Proliferated fibers were stained blue in liver by Masson stain,
and proliferated collagen I fibers were stained red by Sirus Red stain in liver (Fig 5b). The levels
of collagen I and III in the serum and liver of the model mice were determined to facilitate a
quantitative assessment of the major extracellular matrix proteins. Compared with normal mice
at 1 month p.i., model mice showed a 20–45% increase in collagen I (Fig 6a) and a 30–70%

were next used to examine the expression of fibrosis related proteins and genes, respectively.
The levels of TGF-β1 and TIMP-1 protein (Fig 6c) and mRNA (Fig 6d) were significantly higher
in HBV(+) mice than in HBV(-) mice. These results suggest that AAV-HBV injection did not
induce a serious acute inflammatory response, whereas it did induce fibrosis and chronic liver
injury.

Discussion

mouse liver cells. Mice were injected with the AAV8-1.2HBV vector via the tail vein, which

initiated HBV production with persistent antigenemia, viremia and hepatic fibrosis with no obvious acute inflammation. HBV replication, transcription, and expression persisted for more
than 6 months. The viremia level was similar to that previously reported for an adenovirus vector-mediated mouse model [20, 21] and a transfection mouse model established via hydrodynamic injection of naked DNA [22]. The small animal model is desirable for evaluating the
effects of antiviral treatment and has several advantages over other mouse models. For example, in the HBV-transgenic mouse model, the HBV genome cannot be eliminated due to integrate into the host genome. In other work, Adenoviral vectors carrying a 1.3-fold HBV genome
to mouse liver, and HBV replication was established successfully, and HBV viremia was detectable in the serum; however, the persistent infection using AdHBV vectors is severely restricted
by the immune response against the vectors capsid [21]. In the hydrodynamic mouse model,
only a small ratio of mouse hepatocytes were transduced and the viral replication rate persisted
low. The HBV replication levels also decreased after 7 days in immunocompetent mice, and
HBV was already eliminated from the blood 1 week later [22].
In the present study, AAV8-1.2HBV infection successfully constructed a model of persistent
HBV infection (prolonged high-level viremia and antigenemia). There was little or no acute infection or liver inflammation, as indicated by normal transaminase levels and low levels of lymphocyte infiltration (Fig 5b); however, the mice did develop chronic liver disease,
demonstrated by the presence of ground glass-like hepatocytes like that was observed in the
chronically-infected patients livers[36–38]. This is very like the pathogenesis in adults; patients
develop persistent infection with HBV after acute infection and evolve chronic infection with
different degrees of severity[39, 40]. Generally, the liver diseases is usually thought caused by
the immune response against viral antigens but not virus itself [40, 41]. There was no direct cytopathic effects on hepatocytes by HBV infection by the presence of a lot of asymptomatic
chronic HBV carriers with no signs of liver injury[42]. Previous studies found defects of the
immune response in HBV chronic infected patients, including reduction of HBV-specific antibodies[43, 44], delayed lymphocytes migration, and increment of suppressor lymphocytes[45].
Circulating HBsAg is probably the mechanism of defective immune response in HBV carriers
[43, 46]. Further studies are needed to identify the immunological factors that responsible for
the development of pathogenesis during persistent HBV infection in this mouse model and to
identify the correlation between liver fibrosis and the immune response.
Liver fibrosis is a utmost pathway to most chronic liver diseases and evolvements as a consequence of liver damage caused by viral, parasitic, toxic, metabolic, and or autoimmune disorders[47]. The stylemark of liver fibrosis is the increment in the degree and composition of the
extracellular matrix, which leads to the deposition of collagen I. Hepatic stellate cells post an
important role in liver fibrogenesis[48–50]. Several factors could stimulate resting hepatic stellate cells to an active fibrogenic cell type. Activated hepatic stellate cells generate fibrotic components, including collagen type I, inhibitors of matrix degradation such as TIMP-1, and other
growth factors (TGF-β1, etc.)[51]. The novel mouse model described herein showed up-regulation of fibrotic markers, such as type I collagen and type III collagen, in the liver and serum.
TIMP-1 is a critical factor regarded to fibrogenesis and can prohibit the degradation of the extracellular matrix, and its expression leads to the deposition of extracellular matrix in models
of liver fibrosis[52]. TIMP-1 was also significantly increased in the serum of the model mice in
the present study. TGF-β1 plays a major role in the homeostasis of fibrogenesis processes, and
its expression was up-regulated and maintained throughout the fibrotic process in the present
study.
In summary, we have developed a model of persistent HBV infection that induced liver fibrosis in immunocompetent mice, which resembles that in patients with chronic HBV infection. Although previous studies have established mouse models of liver fibrosis[53–55], no

current animal model mimics liver fibrosis during long-term HBV infection in immune competent mice. Therefore, this new model may be useful for investigating the precise mechanisms
that underlie liver fibrosis during chronic HBV infection, and may facilitate the development
of new therapeutics.
