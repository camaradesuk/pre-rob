Docosahexaenoic acid improves behavior and
attenuates blood–brain barrier injury induced by
focal cerebral ischemia in rats

Abstract
Background: Ischemic brain injury disrupts the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and then triggers a cascade of events,
leading to edema formation, secondary brain injury and poor neurological outcomes. Recently, we have shown that
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) improves functional and histological outcomes following experimental stroke. However,
little is known about the effect of DHA on BBB dysfunction after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The present study
was designed to determine whether DHA protects against BBB disruption after focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
Methods: Physiologically-controlled SD rats received 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). DHA (5 mg/kg) or
vehicle (saline) was administered I.V. at 3 h after onset of MCAo. Fluorometric quantitation of Evans Blue dye (EB) was
performed in eight brain regions at 6 h, 24 h or 72 h after MCAo. Fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) - dextran leakage and
histopathology was evaluated on day 3 after stroke.
Results: Physiological variables were stable and showed no significant differences between groups. DHA improved
neurological deficits at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h and decreased EB extravasation in the ischemic hemisphere at 6 h (by 30%),
24 h (by 48%) and 72 h (by 38%). In addition, EB extravasation was decreased by DHA in the cortex and total
hemisphere as well. FITC-dextran leakage was reduced by DHA treatment on day 3 by 68% compared to the saline
group. DHA treatment attenuated cortical (by 50%) and total infarct volume (by 38%) compared to vehicle-treated
rats on day 3 after stroke.
Conclusions: DHA therapy diminishes BBB damage accompanied with the acceleration of behavioral recovery
and attenuation of the infarct volume. It is reasonable to propose that DHA has the potential for treating focal
ischemic stroke in the clinical setting.

Introduction
Cerebral ischemia can cause blood–brain barrier (BBB)
disruption and increased cerebral vascular permeability,
leading to the formation of brain edema [1,2]. Clinically,
BBB disruption occurs in more than one third of stroke
patients and is associated with poor outcomes and lower
survival rates following stroke [3,4]. In animal models of
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion, BBB disruption is believed to be biphasic, which implies an early first opening (at 3–6 h) followed by a refractory period when the

BBB is closed, and a delayed second opening (at 48–72 h)
[5,6]. Since cerebral ischemia and BBB damage are closely
correlated, so approaches for protecting BBB integrity and
reducing BBB permeability could help elucidate the pathophysiological mechanism in brain ischemia, leading to
novel therapies as well as providing a mechanistic roadmap to evaluate efficacy of treatment [7].
Recently, we have shown that docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA; 22:6, n-3), a member of the essential omega-3
fatty acid family, improves functional and histological
outcomes in experimental stroke [8,9]. DHA is highly
concentrated in the brain and is involved in cognition
and other brain functions [10,11]. DHA is the precursor
of the docosanoids, and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1;

acid), being the first identified member of this group of
mediators, inhibits oxidative stress-induced proinflammatory gene expression and promotes cell survival [12,13].
DHA is involved in excitable membrane function, neuronal signaling and has been implicated in neuroprotection
[8,9]. DHA administration improves histological and
neurological outcome following focal cerebral ischemia in
rats when treatment is initiated as late as 5 hours after
ischemia onset [9].
Many methods for assessing the disruption of the
blood–brain barrier have been adopted in experimental
models [14]. Small (EB, 68 kDa) and large (FITC-dextran,
2000 kDa) tracers were used here to evaluate BBB permeability. Although distribution of these two markers are
similar (primarily, if not exclusively, extracellular), intracellular and extracellular uptake of EB was reported [15].
Serum albumin-bound EB crosses the easily broken BBB,
and its regional fluorometric quantification provides the
precise assessment of the degree of BBB disruption in ischemic injury [16]. Subsequently, the presence or absence
of highly localized extracellular FITC-dextran leakage has
been used to identify brain regions undergoing vascular
disruption and to label the severely damaged BBB [15,17].
The present study was designed to determine whether
DHA protects against BBB disruption after focal cerebral
ischemia in rats.

Materials and methods
Animal preparation

The present study was conducted in accordance with
the NIH guidelines for the care and use of animals in research and under protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Louisiana State
University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans. Male
Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (3–4 months-old); Charles
River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) were fasted overnight
with free access to water prior to the surgical procedure.
Anesthesia was induced by the inhalation of 3% isoflurane
in 70% NO and 30% O2 mixed gases, and then maintained
with 1% isoflurane in the same mixed gases during the procedure. Orally-intubated animals were mechanically ventilated after the immobilization by injection of pancronium
bromide (0.5 mg/kg, I.V.). The catheters were implanted
into the right femoral artery and vein for the blood sampling and infusion of drug, EB and FITC-dextran. Serial
analyses of arterial blood gases and plasma glucose were
conducted before and during surgical procedure. Rectal
(CMA/150 Temperature Controller, CMA/Microdialysis
AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and cranial (temporalis muscle;
Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT) temperatures were
closely monitored before, during and after MCAo. Rectal
temperature and body weight were monitored daily and
before sacrifice during the survival period.

Transient Middle Cerebral Artery occlusion (MCAo)

The right MCA was occluded for 2 h by intraluminal
filament, as we described previously [18]. Briefly, the
right common carotid artery (CCA) and external carotid
artery (ECA) were exposed through midline neck incision, and then completely isolated from the surrounding
nerves. The occipital branches of the ECA and pterygopalatine artery were ligated. A 4-cm of 3–0 nylon filament, coated with poly-L-lysine was advanced to the
origin of MCA through the proximal ECA via internal
carotid artery. The filament was inserted 20 to 22 mm
from the bifurcation of the CCA, according to the animal’s body weight. The neck incision was then closed
and rats were returned to their cages. After 2 h of
MCAo, the rats were re-anesthetized with the same
anesthetic combination and the intraluminal filament
was gently removed. The animals were allowed to survive for different times according the experimental
protocol with free access to water and food.
Behavioral tests

Behavioral tests were conducted before, during MCAo
(at 60 min), and then at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h after MCAo
by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental
groups. The battery consisted of two tests, (1) postural
reflex to examine the upper body posture when the rat
was suspended by tail, and (2) forelimb placing test to
assess the forelimb placing responses to visual, tactile
and proprioceptive stimuli [18]. Neurologic function was
graded on a scale of 0 to 12 (normal =0, maximal deficits = 12), as we described previously [18]. The severity
of stroke injury was assessed by behavioral examination
of each rat at 60 min after onset of MCAo. Rats that did
not demonstrate high-grade contralateral deficit (score,
10–11) were excluded from further study. Two animals
were excluded for this reason.
Treatment groups

Animals were randomly assigned to DHA (5 mg/kg,
Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) or vehicle (0.9% saline) treatment
groups. All treatments were administered intravenously at
3 h after the onset of MCAo at a constant rate over 3 min
using an infusion pump. The DHA dose–response study in
rats with transient focal cerebral ischemia showed that a
5 mg/kg dosage was highly neuroprotective [8]; thus this
dose was applied in this study.
Study protocols

Two protocols were used. In series 1, BBB leakage was
studied by EB dye. The neurological status was evaluated
at 6, 24 and 72 h followed by EB measurement at 6, 24
or 72 h (n = 8-12 rats per group). In series 2, BBB leakage was assessed by FITC-dextran. Behavioral score was
measured on days 1, 2 and 3. On Day 3, FITC-dextran

Hong et al. Experimental & Translational Stroke Medicine (2015) 7:3

leakage was analyzed followed by histopathology (n = 5-7
rats per groups). EB, FITC and histopathological analyses were conducted by an investigator who was blinded
to the experimental groups.
Evaluation of BBB leakage by Evans Blue (EB) dye

The integrity of the BBB was investigated using EB extravasation [19]. EB (2%, 4 ml/kg, in saline, SigmaAldrich, MO) was injected intravenously either at 5 h,
23 h or 71 h after MCAo. After 1 h of EB circulation,
rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and were transcardially perfused with saline until colorless fluid was observed from the right atrium. After decapitation, the
removed brains were divided into two coronal blocks
that included the bregma levels + 0.3 and – 1.8 mm.
Coronal blocks were divided into right and left hemisphere, and were cut into eight regions for local measurement of EB dye (see Figure 1). EB extravasation into
the brain was measured as we previously described [19].
Samples were weighed and placed in 50% of tricholoroacetic acid. Following homogenization and centrifugation
at 10000 RPM for 20 min, extracted EB dye was diluted
with ethanol (1:3) and its fluorescence was determined
(excitation at 620 nm and emission at 680 nm) by a
Spectra Max M5e (Molecular Devices, CA). External
standards were prepared in a range of 100 – 500 ng/ml
in the same solvent. The tissue content of EB was

Page 3 of 10

calculated based on the linear standard curve and
expressed as μg of EB/g of tissue.
Evaluation of BBB leakage by fluorescein isothiocyanate
dextran (FITC-dextran)

FITC-dextran (2000 kDa, 1 ml, 50 mg/ml, in saline,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was intravenously injected
at 72 h after MCAo [20,21]. After 1 min of circulation,
brains were removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
24 h, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 48 h and then
coronally sectioned (20 μm-thickness) using the cryostat. Mosaic fluorescent images of the sections were
obtained at six bregma levels (+2.7, + 1.2, − 0.3, − 1.3, −
1.8 and - 3.8 mm) with fluorescence motorized microscope (BX61VS, Olympus, Japan) at a 10 X magnification
objective lens. Regional FITC-dextran fluorescent intensity
in the ipsi- and contra-lateral cortex, subcortex and hemisphere were measured by Image J (National Institute of
Health, Bethesda, MD). Optical density was measured
by applying the following formula: (Right fluorescent
intensity – Left fluorescent intensity)/Left fluorescent
intensity × 100.
Histopathology

Histopathology was performed after the evaluation of BBB
leakage by FITC-dextran at 72 h as we previously described [18]. Adjacent coronal sections (20 μm-thickness)
from FITC-dextran study were stained with thionine
(Nissl). Stained sections at nine standardized bregma
levels were digitized, and then cortical, subcortical infarct
areas were outlined and measured as well as the both
hemispheres using MCID core imaging software (InterFocus Imaging Ltd., Cambridge, England). Infarct volume
was quantified as an integrated product of cross-sectional
infarct areas and intersectional distance and corrected for
brain swelling. Computer generated mosaic images of
stained sections were obtained by motorized microscope
(BX61VS, Olympus, Japan) at a 10 X magnification objective lens.
Statistical analysis

Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA),
followed by Bonferroni tests, was used for multiple-group
comparisons. Two-tailed Student’s T-test was used for
two-group comparisons. A value of p < 0.05 was regarded
as statistically significant. Values are presented as means ±
SEM. Statistical analyses were conducted by Prism 5
(Graph Pad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).

Total neurologic scores were improved in the 24 and

vehicle-treated groups (Figure 2). There were no differences in the behavioral score between DHA and saline
6 h groups (Figure 2). Tissue leakage of EB was clearly
related to cerebral ischemia and presented in Figure 3.
Tissue leakage of EB was clearly related to cerebral ischemia, as presented in Figure 3. The brains of the
saline-treated rats showed intense blue staining at 6 and
72 h, which were observed predominantly in the ventromedial striatum and the cortex ipsilateral to the MCAo
(Figure 3). On the contrary, in the DHA-treated rats,

cortical and subcortical regions showed only faint blue
staining (Figure 3). DHA treatment significantly reduced
EB dye extravasation (Figure 4) into the cortex (at 72 h)
and subcortex (at 6, 24 and 72 h). In addition, EB content of the right hemisphere and total EB from the
whole brain (Figure 4) were also significantly decreased
in all DHA-treated groups compared with the corresponding vehicle group at 6, 24 and 72 h.

in the saline-treated rats. By contrast, FITC-dextran
leakage was dramatically reduced by DHA treatment
from the microvessels of the ischemic area in both the
cortex and subcortex (Figure 6). The alteration of FITCdextran leakage was measured by the relative FITCdextran fluorescent intensity to the comparable regions
of non-ischemic hemisphere. DHA treatment significantly decreased the relative fluorescence intensity at
multiple bregma levels in the cortex and the entire

hemisphere compared to the vehicle group (Figure 7A).
In addition, total relative fluorescent intensity in the
cortex and hemisphere (Figure 7B) was reduced by
DHA treatment compared to the vehicle group. Treatment with DHA demonstrated a consistent smaller lesion involving cortical and subcortical regions in the
right hemisphere at 72 h after MCAo compared to
vehicle group (Figure 8A). DHA treated group significantly reduced the cortical and total infarct areas at
multiple bregma levels compared to vehicle treated

Discussion
In the present study, we have established a protective
effect of DHA treatment against BBB disruption after
experimental focal cerebral ischemia. Post-ischemic
administration of DHA robustly protected against

DHA or saline treatments were administered at 1 h after 2 h of MCAo.
Total neurologic score (normal = 0, maximal deficits = 12) was measured
during MCAo and then at 24, 48 and 72 h after MCAo. The degree of
behavioral recovery in DHA-treated animals exceeded that of saline

ischemia-induced BBB disruption, as evidenced by reduced EB extravasation and FITC-dextran leakage, improved the neurological deficits and attenuated infarct
volume. Moreover, there were no adverse behavioral
side effects observed with DHA administration. Our
results suggest that this approach might be adaptable
as a therapeutic avenue.
Cerebral ischemia results in rapid accumulation of free
fatty acids, including arachidonic acid (ArAc; 20:4) and
DHA [10,11]. These fatty acids are released from membrane phospholipids. Both fatty acids are derived from
dietary essential fatty acids; however, only DHA, from
the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acyl chain, is concentrated in phospholipids of various cells of the brain and
retina [22]. Synaptic membranes and photoreceptors
share the highest content of DHA of all cell membranes.
DHA, one of the main structural lipids in the mammalian brain, plays crucial roles in the development and
function of brain neurons [10,12]. It is involved in memory formation, promotes neurogenesis both in vitro and
in vivo; and has been implicated in neuroprotection
[8,9,23-25]. In vivo, the active DHA supply to the brain
(provided by the liver through the blood stream) is necessary for cell development and function. It also may
play a critical role in conditions where, due to enhanced
oxidative stress, the polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains of
membrane phospholipids are decreased as a consequence
of lipid peroxidation, as occurs in aging, retinal degenerations, and neurodegenerations such as Alzheimer disease
[26,27]. In ischemia, there is also loss of brain DHA due

to breakdown of enhanced phospholipase A2-activated
DHA-containing phospholipids [23].
Beneficial effects of DHA in preventing and ameliorating stroke damage have been attributed to generation of
the stereospecific derivative, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1),
which is a key survival signaling event leading to

neuroprotection [22,28,29]. Recently, we have identified
NPD1 following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in the
mouse [28]. NPD1 was found to serve an endogenous
neuroprotective role by inhibiting apoptotic DNA damage, upregulating anti-apoptotic and downregulating
pro-apoptotic proteins, and also binding toxic peroxides

compared to saline treated animal. (B) Infarct areas at standardized bregma levels. DHA decreased cortical and total infarct areas at multiple bregma
levels compared to vehicle group. (C) Infarct volume in cortex, subcortex and total hemisphere. DHA-treated animals were observed significant reduction
of cortical and total infarct volume compared to vehicle-treated animals. Values are mean ± SEM; n = 5-6 rats per group. *Significantly different
form corresponding saline group (p < 0.05, repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni tests: comparison of infarct areas; Student’s T-test:
comparison of infarct volume).

[26,28,29]. We demonstrated that NPD1 synthesis takes
place in the ipsilateral side of ischemic brain and peaks
at 8 h of reperfusion, and then decreases and is still detectable 25 h after reperfusion [24,28]. Although DHA
in the brain can produce NPD1, additional DHA from
acute administration is beneficial because lipidomic analysis shows that it potentiates NPD1 synthesis in the
penumbra [9,30].
A variety of biologic effects of DHA have been demonstrated with fish or fish oil supplements in humans [31].
They have been found to reduce cholesterol, lower blood
pressure, block clot-promoting platelet activation, prevent heart arrhythmias, prevent vascular inflammation
and improve vascular function, and protect the heart
muscle following a heart attack [32,33]. Epidemiologic
studies provide evidence for a beneficial effect of omega3 fatty acids on manifestations of coronary heart disease
and ischemic stroke, particularly with respect to sudden

cardiac death in patients with established disease [34].
Clinically important anti-inflammatory effects in humans
are further suggested by trials demonstrating benefits of
omega-3 fatty acids in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis,
asthma, inflammatory bowel disorders, osteoporosis, sepsis and cancer [31].
Vascular damage during cerebral ischemia occurs early
and it progresses in a biphasic manner [5], contributing
to the development of brain edema, hemorrhagic transformation, and worsened clinical outcome in stroke
patients [35]. The BBB has a central role in stroke
pathogenesis and it is a therapeutic target. Many drugs
have been screened to protect BBB permeability integrity
and reduce ischemic brain damage by targeting different
mechanisms [36]. Unfortunately, so far there are no effective therapeutic interventions for BBB disruption [3].
DHA presence in vascular endothelial cells in the brain
suggests that this fatty acid is incorporated into these

Hong et al. Experimental & Translational Stroke Medicine (2015) 7:3

cells from the systemic circulation [37-39]. DHA in the
cell membrane endows fluidity and proper functioning
[40]. Furthermore, DHA enriched phospholipids in cellular membranes influences the function of BBB and
signaling properties of neurons through fostering a dynamic environment to membrane-associated receptors
or enzymes of the BBB compartment [41]. Little is
known about the effect of DHA on BBB dysfunction
after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The beneficial
effects of pre-treatment with DHA have been reported
on BBB disruption, brain edema and inflammatory cell
infiltration [42,43]. In contrast, one study showed that
post-treatment with DHA (500 nmol/kg, i.p.at 60 min
after 90 min of MCAo) exacerbated cerebral ischemic
injury and increased BBB permeability in the ischemic
cortex at 24 h after reperfusion [44]; note that the DHA
dosage applied was 100 times less than in our study.
Our study revealed that DHA administration decreased
EB extravasation in the ischemic hemisphere at 6 h (by
30%), 24 h (by 48%) and 72 h (by 38%) compared to
vehicle-treated rats. In addition, EB extravasation was
decreased by DHA treatment in the cortex at 72 h (by
36%) and subcortex at 6 h (by 32%), at 24 h (by 45%)
and at 72 h (by 40%) as well as the reduction into the
entire brain at 6 h (by 30%), at 24 h (by 49%) and at
72 h (by 31%) compared to the corresponding vehicle
groups. We also found that treatment with DHA also
suppressed FITC-dextran leakage into the cortex (by
67%) and entire hemisphere (by 71%) compared to the
saline-treated animals at 72 h after onset of stroke. In
addition, DHA attenuated cortical (by 50%) and total infarct volumes (by 38%) compared to the saline-treated
rats at 72 h. These results strongly demonstrate that
DHA protects the severely-damaged BBB, accompanied
by a relief of abnormal BBB permeability in the delayed
ischemic reperfusion damage.
The exact mechanism by which DHA protects the
BBB requires further investigation. The beneficial effect
of DHA has been shown in a well-controlled animal
model of MCAo. In the present study, and in recently
published observations [9,13], we have employed a polyL-lysine coated filament and have found that this technique leads to a 100% incidence of infarction following
2 h of MCAo, predictable size and location of the infarct, and a high degree of inter-animal reproducibility
of infarct size (coefficient of variation 8%) [18]. We demonstrated that DHA did not have direct effects on body
and cranial temperatures or arterial blood gases because
these variables were carefully controlled and did not
differ among groups.

Conclusions
Our results show that DHA is markedly neuroprotective
in an experimental stroke model in rats, diminishing

BBB damage accompanied with an improvement of behavioral functions and attenuation of the infarct volume.
We therefore suggest that this agent offers great promise
for developing therapies for cerebral ischemia in patients
with acute ischemic stroke.
